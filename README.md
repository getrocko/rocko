# Welcome to Rocko
### Onchain borrowing made easy â€” for everyone

Crypto owners can now use Rocko to quickly get a loan using their crypto as collateral and avoid having to sell. Users can access competitive rates from popular DeFi protocols â€” starting with Compound â€” and set up a loan in minutes, no matter their level of expertise.

_**Our vision is to build one marketplace that allows borrowers to easily access the best rates from protocols across many networks and using any crypto asset. We want to make DeFi easy for everyone.**_

## ðŸ’ª What makes Rocko different?

Rocko is _designed for the average crypto owner_, not the experts. Regardless of prior DeFi experience, users can set up a loan in minutes using an intuitive, step-by-step interface that allows them to view and compare key loan terms such as interest rates, projected liquidation price, and more.

Upon finalizing their loan, _users receive a smart wallet_ that will automatically interact with the chosen DeFi protocol and fulfill their loan based on the info they provided. Because the smart wallet is non-custodial, Rocko users retain full and exclusive control over any funds held by their smart wallet. Additionally, this allows users to fund the collateral and receive the loan directly to their exchange account â€” no MetaMask or seed phrase required!

Users can manage their loan via a personal dashboard which allows them to track key metrics, make payments, and more. They can also set up _SMS or email alerts_ to monitor the value of their collateral and the interest rate for their loan.

## ðŸ”œ What's next?

_Rocko currently supports USDC loans_ from Compound on Ethereum Mainnet using ETH as collateral, although we're also working to add more protocols, networks, and crypto assets. We'd love to hear what else people would be excited to see and/or any feedback on the product. For crypto owners, why would or wouldn't you use this product? Thanks for the taking the time to learn more!
